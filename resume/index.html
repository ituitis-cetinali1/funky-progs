	 <h1 style="padding:100px;">Welcome to Data-Protected Devolopment!</h1> 
		
	
<p>Hi. My name is Ali and I develop websites and mobile applications with data security in mind.</p>
<p>If it bothers you to be constantly watched by companies when you are going your daily routine,
<p>or if you you would like to provide a better solution for your customers who care about their personal information,</p>
<p>then you are in the right place!</p>


	<h2 style="padding:100px 100px 0px 100px;">About Me</h2>

<div style="float:right;width:400px; padding:50px;">
<p>I graduated from Istanbul Technical University in 2023 and started to work on web development.</p>
<p>I started my business by building several websites to local enterprises when I was a student</p>
<p>By the time i graduated I was working on developing mobile apps myself and that is where I learned the importance of personal information.</p>
<p>After finding out what kinds of tricks the big companies do to get peoples personal info, I decided to do something about it!</p>
<p>At first I decided to make it more clear to users that you can say no to companies tracking your info and I developed the tracker-tracker application. I made people know how they can turn the tracking off and which sites or apps were tracking them until then.</p>
<p>After finding out how some websites refuse to turn off their tracking by claiming "bugs", I decided to develop the tracker-tricker, the website that gives the other websites the wrong idea about you.</p>
